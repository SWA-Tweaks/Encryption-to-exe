The encryption.bat file is a script that converts a .bat or .cmd file into an .exe without executing it.
Users can extract and embed their batch or command script into the .exe, making it impossible for others to decrypt or access the original code.
This ensures secure execution while keeping the script hidden from modification or reverse engineering.
